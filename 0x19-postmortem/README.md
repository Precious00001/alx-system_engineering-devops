  - Users felt like they were waiting for a tortoise to finish a marathon – productivity dropped like a hot potato.
  - About 75% of our users joined us on this unexpected slow-motion journey.

**Timeline:**

- **Issue Detected:** 
  - Drumroll, please! 🥁
  - The AI-powered alert dragon woke up and roared at 2023-03-15 14:00 UTC. It sensed unusually high server load.

- **Actions Taken:**
  - Our intrepid operations team donned their detective hats and dove headfirst into the digital jungle, suspecting server exhaustion.
  - Logs were scrutinized, CPU and memory were put under the magnifying glass, and network traffic was analyzed.

- **Misleading Investigation/Debugging Paths:**
  - Plot twist! 📜
  - Initial theories pointed fingers at a massive surge in traffic. We even added extra server muscles to lift the load, but alas, it wasn't the hero we needed.

- **Escalation:**
  - Cue the cavalry! 🏇
  - At 2023-03-15 15:30 UTC, we hoisted the distress signal high into the digital sky and summoned our development team.
  - The troops arrived, battle-ready, to join the quest for answers.

- **Resolution:**
  - The Eureka moment! 💡
  - At 2023-03-15 17:15 UTC, we discovered the hidden treasure. It wasn't traffic; it was a rogue database query.
  - This query had gone rogue and was acting out, causing slow database responses. It needed a timeout.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**

- **Root Cause:**
  - In a plot twist worthy of a Hollywood blockbuster, the villain turned out to be a misconfigured database query introduced during a code deployment.
  - It rebelled against its proper database etiquette, opting for a slow dance of full table scans.

- **Resolution:**
  - Our valiant development team, armed with the sword of knowledge and the shield of determination, swiftly reverted the query to its former, well-behaved self.
  - The database cheered, the web service sang, and our users danced in the digital streets as everything returned to normal.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**

- **To Improve/Fix:**
  - Lessons learned! We're enhancing our code deployment process with extra checkpoints and an army of code reviewers to catch any query shenanigans.
  - Our monitoring system is getting a superhero upgrade to spot slow database queries and alert us before they start any mischief.

- **Tasks to Address the Issue:**
  - Create automated code review checks for database queries during deployments.
  - Host a post-mortem meeting, complete with virtual popcorn, to dissect the incident and forge a path to a brighter future.
  - Equip our monitoring with query performance alerts to prevent future query tantrums.

There you have it, folks, the epic tale of The Great Database Query Quandary! 🚀 Stay tuned for more tech adventures, and remember, even in the darkest digital dungeons, there's always a solution waiting to be uncovered. 🌟
